# Event_Knowledge_Model_Comparison

A series of experiments with the aim of study which computational model performs better among others.

## Requirements

## Datasets
- DTFit
- ev1
- newsentences_EventsAdapt

## Models

- **ANNs**

Verb prediction (bidirectional ANNs)

Sequential word prediction (bidirectional ANNs)

Pseudo-log likelihood: start from unmasked sentence, mask each word iteratively)

Left-to-right generation: start from completely masked sentence and unmask words left-to-right (Sequential Sampling)

Sequential word prediction (unidirectional ANNs)
